## Summary
I am an enthusiast, I basically work on anything that I find interesting and regularly start side projects, not all of which work out, but I ensure that I have learned something every time. Recently I've been playing with self-hosting (specifically to learn a bit about the underlying hardware and software which power my professional career) and home automation. I'm also interested in contributing to open source, specifically I have been targeting [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) recently and have made a few starter contributions.
